# 🐑 Qurbani Transparency Dashboard

This project is a **dashboard interface** for a web application that ensures **transparency during Eid al-Adha sheep sacrifices**. The goal is to offer donors peace of mind by providing visual proof (e.g., videos) that their donated sheep was slaughtered and delivered to the intended recipients.

## 🎯 Purpose

The dashboard serves as an **admin panel** for overseeing all aspects of Qurbani operations — from sheep donations to distribution, worker coordination, recipient management, and feedback collection.
